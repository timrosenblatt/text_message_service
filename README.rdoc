Going to use memcache as the hotcache, DB for cold. Expiration will be
straightforward.

install with `brew install memcached` or whatever you prefer

The app assumes memcache is already running

Any need for DB transactions?

Add a task for warming a cold cache from DB

Switch to pgsql

Switch to redis if we're expecting massive messages or large volumes

Memcache connection pool so we don't have to re-initialize every time.
